# Unemployment and the Minimum Wage Increase in Arizona
This repository contains the code and presentation materials for an independent research project that investigates the impact of minimum wage increase on unemployment in Arizona using causal inference techniques.

## Project Overview

Research Question: What is the treatment effect of Arizona's minimum wage increase on its unemployment rate?

## Methodology

Data Wrangling: Python's pandas library is utilized for data cleaning and transformation to prepare the data for analysis within a single dataframe.

Causal Inference: Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis is employed on the data to estimate the causal effect of the minimum wage increase on unemployment.

Data Visualization: Matplotlib is used for creating visualizations that aid in understanding key trends and patterns in the data.

Presentation: The project's findings and insights are presented using Microsoft Excel for key metrics and a PowerPoint presentation for visual communication.
