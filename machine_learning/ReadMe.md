# Machine Learning Projects
This repository hosts various machine learning projects, each solving unique problems and demonstrating skills in data preprocessing, model development, and analysis.

## Project List

### 1. RDR Horse Identifier

An image classification model is developed to differentiate between Red Dead Redemption (RDR) video game horses and real horses. The project includes the analysis of model predictions using confusion matrices and top loss analysis.

### 2. Income Predictor

A binary classification model is built to predict income levels. The project showcases data preprocessing and transformation and model training with sklearn using the XGBoost algorithm.

### 3. Titanic Kaggle Project

This project involves the classic Titanic dataset from Kaggle, focusing on predicting passenger survival based on various features.
